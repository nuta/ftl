//! Frequently used types and traits.
//!
//! The [`prelude`] module contains the most common types and traits to
//! import. Here is an idiomatic way to import the prelude:
//!
//! ```
//! use ftl_api::prelude::*;
//!
//! let mut v = Vec::new();
//! v.push(1);
//! ```
//!
//! # What's in the prelude?
//!
//! Since FTL apps are `#![no_std]` crates, this prelude includes types from
//! [`alloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/index.html) so that experienced
//! Rust programmers can use familiar types without asking *"Where is `Vec`?"*.
//!
//! # Why should I use the prelude?
//!
//! You don't have to use the prelude. However, it's a convenient way to
//! reduce the number of your keystrokes.
