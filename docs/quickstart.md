In this guide, we'll prepare a development environment and write a Hello World application.

## Clone the repository

The first step is to download the repository to your local machine. Just clone it from GitHub:

```
git clone TODO
```

## Install prerequisites

We support macOS, Linux (Ubuntu), and WSL2 (Ubuntu) for development. You will need to install the following tools:

- [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- GNU Make (`make`)
- Python (`python3`)
- QEMU (`qemu`)

### Install packages

On macOS, you can install these tools using Homebrew:

```
brew install qemu python3
```

On Ubuntu, you can install these tools using `apt`:

```
sudo apt install qemu-system python3 make
```

### Rust nightly toolchain

You also need to install the Rust nightly toolchain:

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
rustup target add riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf
rustup component add rust-src llvm-tools
```

## Run on QEMU

To run FTL on QEMU, just type `make run`:

```
$ make run
[kernel      ] INFO   FTL - Faster Than "L"
[kernel      ] DEBUG  free memory: 0x0000000082942000 - 0x0000000086942000 (64 MiB)
[kernel      ] TRACE  PLIC: paddr=0xc000000

...
```

That's it!

## Next Steps

Now you have a development environment ready. Let's write your first application! See [Writing Your First Application](guides/writing-your-first-application.md) for the next steps.
