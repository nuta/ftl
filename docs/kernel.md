# Kernel

## Channel

## System calls

### `channel_send(ch, header, buf, handles) -> ()`

Sends a message. The message will be delivered to `ch`'s peer.

If the kernel fails returns an error code, it's guaranteed that `handles` will not be transferred. That is, **the caller must keep ownership of the handles**. This is why `Channel::send` returns `SendError` instead of `FtlError`.

# Layout

```plain

|63 or 31                                      14|13   12|11         0|
+------------------------------------------------+-------+------------+
|                        ID                      |   H   |    LEN     |
+------------------------------------------------+-------+------------+

LEN  (12 bits) - # of bytes in the message data.
H    (2 bits)  - # of handles in the message.
ID (rest)    - Message ID.

```

# Design decisions

## A single `isize` for `ID`, `H`, and `LEN`

- It can fit in a single CPU register. Specifying the message metadata
  can be done with simply setting an immediate value to a register.

- The message structure (i.e. its length and the number of handles) can be
  validated at once when checking the message ID.

- It forcibly limits the message data length and the number of handles, in
  other words, the kernel just need to do bitwise AND operations to get them,
  without any additional checks.

## Message metadata is not part of the message buffer

- If it was part of the message buffer, the kernel would need to read the
  message buffer first to determine the number/length of handles/data that
  it needs to copy.

- It's useful for debugging. We can determine the message ID even if an
  app accidentally passed an invalid pointer to the kernel. It could be a
  key clue for debugging.

## The maximum message length is 4095 bytes (0xfff)

- Big enough for inlined file read and ethernet frame. Itâ€™s convenient for prototyping.
- Small enough to keep it allocated, even on the stack. It allows reusing the same memory space for all messages, like L4's virtual/message registers.
- Not big enough for bulk send. It encourages you to use transferring Buffer handle instead of memory copies via kernel.
- Ideally it should be 4KiB to be page-sized, but 4096 (0x1000) will require two steps to read the message length: bitwise AND (0x1fff) and then validate if it's less than 0x1000.
